Apple WWDC App Submission

Notes is an enhanced version of Apple's default Notes app.

Unlike the regular Notes app, my notes app supports color, font, and font-size adjustments.

It also features a new way to organize your notes, allowing users to place their titles in a place that you can read easily (seen above), and also tells the last edit date in the view screen. It also doesn't display the data inside the note, securing your data.

And of course, there are many 3d touch applications, from a shortcut icon, to accessing the edit pane within the app.

I hope you will accept my application.
