It also doesn't display the data inside the note, securing your data.\r\n\r\n![Main Menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheTrueMaster/Notes/master/Images/Notes%20-%20SampleMainMenuScreen.png)\r\n\r\nAnd of course, there are many 3d touch applications, from a shortcut icon, to accessing the edit pane within the app.\r\n\r\n![Shortcut Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheTrueMaster/Notes/master/Images/Notes%20-%20ForceTouchShortcut.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##App Designed and Created by Ronak Shah\r\n\r\n",
